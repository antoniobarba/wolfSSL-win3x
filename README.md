# wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) 
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.2, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, Blake2b and Post-Quantum TLS 1.3 groups. User benchmarking and
feedback reports dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over
OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validation is in progress. For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded, desktop, mobile, or
enterprise SSL/TLS solution. Some of the top reasons include size (typical
footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for the newest standards
(SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, and DTLS 1.2), current
and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-platform,
royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete
feature list, see [Chapter 4](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)
of the wolfSSL manual.

## Notes, Please Read

### Note 1
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with one or more of the following defines:

```
WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK
```
Though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.

When compiling `ssl.c`, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
`WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

### Note 2
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having `SSL_connect` succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

```c
wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, WOLFSSL_VERIFY_NONE, NULL);
```

before calling `wolfSSL_new();`. Though it's not recommended.

### Note 3
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with `--enable-opensslextra` (`OPENSSL_EXTRA`) or with the
macro `NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES`. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a
single call hash function. Instead the name `WC_SHA`, `WC_SHA256`, `WC_SHA384` and
`WC_SHA512` should be used for the enum name.
